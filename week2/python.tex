  We approximate derivatives in Python.
\end{abstract}

There are two different perspectives on the derivative available to us.

Suppose $f : \R^n \to \R^m$ is a differentiable function, and we have
a point $\mathbf{p} \in \R^n$.

The first perspective on the derivative is the \textbf{total
  derivative}, which is \textit{linear map} $Df(p)$ which sends the
vector $\vec{v}$ to $Df(p)(\vec{v})$, recording how much an
infinitesimal change in the $\vec{v}$ direction in $\R^n$ will affect
the output of $f$ in $\R^m$.

The second perspective on the derivative is the \textbf{Jacobian
  matrix}, which is the \textit{matrix of partials} given by
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} \left(\mathbf{p}\right) & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} \left(\mathbf{p}\right) & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}\left(\mathbf{p}\right) \\
  \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} \left(\mathbf{p}\right) & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2} \left(\mathbf{p}\right) & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_n}\left(\mathbf{p}\right) \\
  \vdots                                                    & \vdots                                                    & \ddots & \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} \left(\mathbf{p}\right) & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_2} \left(\mathbf{p}\right) & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}\left(\mathbf{p}\right) 
\end{bmatrix}
\]
The key fact is that this matrix represents the linear map $Df(\mathbf{p})$.  And we can try this out with a bit of Python.
